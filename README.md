# C-for-microcontroller-Intel-8051
The project involved programming a microcontroller Intel 8051 using the C language. Accomplishing this task required knowledge of both C programming and the underlying assembly language implications, as well as reading and understanding technical documenta- tion of microcontroller.

I create a counter, menu with various functions, counter affects PWM. There is both sides serial transmission that informs about counter value or can change it (as an alternative to buttons and menu).
